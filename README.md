# Concentric_cylindrical_duct

This repository could deal with mode decomposition when the section of the duct is annulus. 
It contains 2 files
1. Duct_mode_concentric.m that calculates the wavenumber and decomposition
2. zerobesscross.m that is from http://freesourcecode.net/matlabprojects/60590/a-function-to-find-the-roots-of-the-bessel-function-cross-products.--in-matlab#.XaVl4xQzbtR
